# Only-Optimized
This is the Only Optimized backup repository, and it's easy for people to use it to communicate here, but there may be a delay in the update here because I often forget what I should do.    
I have a [wiki](https://wiki.dslzl.eu.org) site that uses a hexo front-end powered by GitHub Pages, but it's not perfect and doesn't have an i18n page, so it would be nice if someone could help me with the i18n page or give me advice. (I am Chinese) 🔄  ❓   
Anyway, that's all for now, and I'm going to try to make this modpack as good as possible 🔄  ❓
